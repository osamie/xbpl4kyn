README

To open the GroupDispatcher and GUI, import the GroupDispatcher folder 
into Eclipse. Find and open ElevatorControlWindow.java and run it as a 
Java application. When the UI appears, click start.

To compile the ElevatorController, run the following commands:
	# remove any leftover files from previous builds
	make clean
	# compile
	make
	
To run the ElevatorController, first start the GroupDispatcher and GUI from within Eclipse. Next, from the working directory, run
	./main <group_dispatcher_ip> <group_dispatcher_port> <gui_ip> <gui_port>
	
The 'main' program' should exit it on its own after a single iteration. If not, kill the program with Ctrl-C.
